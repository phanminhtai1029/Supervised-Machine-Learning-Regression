## Topics Covered

### Machine Learning Fundamentals Quiz 1
The first quiz assessed comprehensive understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts, including:

- **Data Splitting and Validation**: Understanding the purpose and proper usage of training data for model fitting, with emphasis on avoiding overfitting and ensuring model generalization through proper train-test splits.

- **Model Types and Applications**: Knowledge of different regression approaches, including linear regression as a linear combination of features and polynomial regression for capturing non-linear relationships in data.

- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Recognition that data leakage occurs when test data information inadvertently influences the training process, and understanding of proper data handling to prevent this issue.

- **Regression Effects**: Understanding of polynomial regression effects and how non-linear patterns can be addressed by adding polynomial features to standard linear regression approaches.

- **Practical Implementation**: Knowledge of sklearn syntax for data splitting, including proper use of train_test_split function with appropriate parameters for test size specification.

- **Feature Engineering**: Understanding of polynomial feature creation using sklearn methods, specifically the use of PolynomialFeatures with degree parameters.

### Polynomial Regression Quiz
This quiz focused specifically on advanced regression techniques:

- **Goal of Polynomial Features**: Understanding that the main objective of adding polynomial features to linear regression is to capture relationships between outcomes and features of higher order, enabling models to fit non-linear patterns.

- **sklearn Implementation Methods**: Knowledge of the most common sklearn methods for adding polynomial features, specifically the combined use of polyFeat.fit and polyFeat.transform functions, where polyFeat represents PolynomialFeatures with specified degree.

- **Practical Applications**: Understanding how to adjust standard linear approaches to regression when dealing with fundamental problems such as prediction or interpretation by adding non-linear patterns through polynomial features.

### Training and Test Splits Quiz
This quiz evaluated understanding of data partitioning techniques:

- **Testing Data Terminology**: Recognition that unseen data is the correct term for testing data, emphasizing the importance of model evaluation on data not used during training.

- **ShuffleSplit vs StratifiedShuffleSplit**: Understanding that ShuffleSplit does not ensure bias prevention in outcome variables, whereas StratifiedShuffleSplit provides that functionality for maintaining class distribution in splits.

- **train_test_split Syntax**: Mastery of proper syntax for obtaining data splits with specific test split sizes, particularly understanding the y_test_size parameter usage (for example, y_test_size=0.33 for a third of the data as test size).

## Recommendations for Continued Learning

While performance on these quizzes was exemplary, consider exploring the following areas to further enhance your machine learning expertise:

- Advanced regularization techniques to prevent overfitting in polynomial regression models, such as Ridge and Lasso regression.

- Cross-validation strategies beyond basic train-test splits, including k-fold cross-validation and time-series specific validation approaches.

- Feature selection methods to identify the most relevant polynomial features and reduce model complexity.

- Practical implementation projects that combine these concepts in real-world datasets to solidify theoretical understanding through hands-on application.
